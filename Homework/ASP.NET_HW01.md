**1. What is HTML?**

* HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web.
* HTML gives authors the means to:
* Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
* Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
* Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
* Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.

**2. What is HTTP?**

* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
distributed object management systems, through extension of its
request methods, error codes and headers

**3. What is middleware?**

* The purpose of the ASP.NET Core platform is to receive HTTP requests and send responses to them, which ASP.NET Core delegates
to middleware components. Middleware components are arranged in a chain, known as the request pipeline.

**4. What is URL routing?**

* URL routing introduces middleware that takes care of matching request URLs so that components,
called endpoints, can focus on responses. The mapping between endpoints and the URLs they require is expressed in a route. The
routing middleware processes the URL, inspects the set of routes and finds the endpoint to handle the request, a process known as
routing.

**5. What is dependency injection?**

* Dependency injection makes it possible to easily access services anywhere in the application, including middleware components.

**6. What is model binding?**

* Model binding is the process of creating .NET objects using the values from the HTTP request to provide easy access to the data
required by action methods and Razor Pages.

**7. What are Razor pages?**

* Razor Pages is the recommended framework for cross-platform server-side HTML generation. Razor Pages makes use of the popular C# 
programming language for server-side programming, and the easy-to-learn Razor templating syntax for embedding C# in HTML mark-up to 
generate content for browsers dynamically.

**8. What is Entity Framework Core?**

* Entity Framework is an Object/Relational Mapping (O/RM) framework. It is an enhancement to ADO.NET that gives developers an automated 
mechanism for accessing & storing the data in the database. 

**9. What is ASP.NET Core Identity?**

* ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that adds login functionality to ASP.NET Core apps. Users can create an account with the login 
information stored in Identity or they can use an external login provider. Identity can be configured using a SQL Server database to store 
user names, passwords, and profile data.

**10. What is the ASP.NET Core platform?**

* ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-enabled, Internet-connected apps. 
With ASP.NET Core, you can: Build web apps and services, Internet of Things (IoT) apps, and mobile backends. Use your favorite development 
tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
